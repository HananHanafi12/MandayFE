📦 Dependencies Changed
Added

Configuration Files
tailwind.config.js - Created with custom colors and animations

🎨 New Features

1. Login Page (src/pages/Login.tsx)
   Button Interactions
   Click Animation: Buttons scale down (95%) when pressed for tactile feedback
   Loading State: Submit button shows spinner and changes text to "Signing In..."
   Disabled State: Form inputs disabled during submission to prevent spam clicking
   Password Field
   Toggle Visibility: Click eye icon to show/hide password
   Dynamic Icon: Icon changes between eye and eye-slash based on state
   Smooth Transitions: Icon hover and click animations
   Loading Screen
   Full-Screen Loader: Displays centered spinner with "Redirecting to dashboard..." text
   Smooth Transition: Appears during authentication redirect
   Error Display
   Enhanced Styling: Red background card with icon
   Shake Animation: Subtle shake effect to draw attention
   Clear Messaging: User-friendly error messages
   Technical Implementation
   tsx
   // New state management
   const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
   const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false);

// Form submission with loading state
const handleLogin = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
setIsSubmitting(true);
try {
await login(email, password);
} catch (error) {
setIsSubmitting(false); // Reset only on error
}
};

// Password toggle
<button onClick={() => setShowPassword(!showPassword)}>
<img src={showPassword ? "eye-slash.svg" : "eye.svg"} />
</button> 2. Merchant Overview (src/pages/OverviewMerchant.tsx)
Skeleton Loader
Purpose: Show content structure while data is loading
Components:
Top bar skeleton
Stats cards skeleton (3 cards)
Transaction list skeleton (2 items)
Animation: Pulse effect for "breathing" appearance
Loading State Management
tsx
const { data, isLoading } = useFetchMerchantTransactions();

if (isLoading) {
return <SkeletonLoader />;
}
Modal Animations
Fade In: Backdrop fades in (200ms)
Slide Up: Content slides up from bottom (300ms)
Interactive Close: Close button with hover and click effects
Bug Fixes
Dynamic Quantity: Fixed hardcoded (2x) to display actual {tp.quantity}x
Button Improvements
All interactive buttons now have active:scale-95 for consistent feedback
Detail buttons include transition animations

Accessibility: Disabled states clearly communicated visually
🔧 Technical Details
State Management
Local component state for UI interactions (useState)
React Query for data fetching with isLoading state
Conditional rendering based on loading/error states
Animation Strategy
GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) for smooth 60fps
Short durations (200-300ms) for snappy feel
Consistent easing functions across all animations
CSS Architecture
Tailwind @layer directives for proper specificity
Custom utilities in separate layer for maintainability
Component classes for reusable button styles
📱 Browser Compatibility
Tested and working on:

Chrome 120+
Firefox 121+
Safari 17+
Edge 120+
All animations use standard CSS properties with excellent browser support.

🐛 Known Issues & Limitations
None at this time.

🔮 Future Enhancement Ideas
Toast notifications for success/error messages
Page transition animations
Optimistic UI updates
Haptic feedback for mobile devices
Advanced micro-interactions on hover states
Retry mechanism for failed requests
